# Description
A model to classify &amp; localize different signs of ageing such as puffy eyes, wrinkles, dark spots etc. on the face.

# Various Responsibilities 
The project requires knowledge of various domains.
Using image processing techniques to process the image as per requirements. The
model preferred to work upon is EfficientNet which will detect signs of ageing like
puffy eyes, wrinkles, dark spots on the image.
